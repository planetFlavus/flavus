>to greet

**karb**, "to welcome" (from which **karbeng**, "house")

>to introduce

**pyrdak**, "to bring".

Ex: "Shlem introduces Yngar to Ardaman":

**Shlem o-Ardaman Yngar pyrdak**

>to thank

**babyr kad**, "to offer (your own) suffering"

>to apologise

**setta kad** "to offer regret"

>to wish (someone) well

**(someone) agarek**, as in **my agarek** "I wish for you to be well". **agarek** is the deontic of **agarak**, "to be well".

>hello!

**Na** (also meaning "yes")

>good morning

>good afternoon

>good evening

>good night

No such concepts exist

>goodbye

**my agaredh**, simply "I wish you well" but in the future tense

>welcome!

>sorry!

**ngon setta kad** or just **setta**

>thanks!

**ngon babyr kad** or just **babyr**

>safe journey!

**my syng edh**, "be safe"

>pleased to meet you

This would not be expressed in words but through a quick hand gesture. Both people would offer their right hand, palm up; then they would tap the other's right palm with their left middle finger. If they are too far apart to touch, just offering the right hand palm is also acceptable.

>see you soon

**rdan sho edh** "I wish we (inclusive) will be together"

>have a good day

No such concept

>enjoy your meal

Flavan food tastes and smells atrocious, so they would never say this.

>have a good trip

A journey for Flavans is automatically dangerous, so good means safe, and it's **my syng edh** again.

>cheers!

No such thing

>who are you?

**my matty?**

literally "you what?"

>how are you?

**adhla matty my?**

>yes

**Na**

>no

**Dy**

>May I introduce Amanda?

**garyk Amanoda**, or to be extra polite:

**my-nana, garyk Amanoda**. **my-nana** is the dual vocative of "you" - the dual (which doubles the vocative postfix **-na**) is used only with new acquaintances to be extremely formal and is quickly dropped as the relationship progresses.

In alternative, **ngon Amanoda pyrdak**, "I bring/introduce Amanda".

>the new year

Instead of years, they prefer to count the synodic period of another planet, the Wanderer, with respect to theirs, and the synodic year starts at the opposition (i.e. closest approach) of the Wanderer, which is thus called a "visit", or

**ttakyba**

>birthdays

**pode shlytta**, "the repeated marking". It's not really a birth-*day* but a birth-*point* at a specific fraction of the synodic year, thus a marking on a line representing the year and which is repeated every visit.
