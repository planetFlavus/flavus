I met Mydar around the day 54, 


kym rda ngon oKorma rarodany pyka.

when I stationed in Korma for a few days. 


Moshl net nar fen ong kattk

She was brought to me by her mother,

after she had noticed the daughter was acting strange.


Fattfyt n Modar otaryng nget kat.

 I immedately brought Mydar to my tent alone. 


Dyp agord, ngon fattfyt bag [goma net rdonaroda] eat, baberbef yrk gagyrbef ena.

Upon examination, I noticed immediately her skin was flaky, in the arms and legs.

She confessed to swimming in the lake.

She said she wanted to silence the spirits that would whisper to her, through her portal. 


otta dhlashlaryb, kyrk maegadd shlyddat kedagyardat

Her nose was dry, so I diagnosed a necrotic imbalance.



nar ttyttakyba kat ong bo kyta-rdyad.

She never came back for the second visit.



She confessed to swimming in the lake. I asked: "why would you do that? Didn't that hurt?". She replied that she did so so they would stop talking. She explained that spirits would whisper to her through her portal. Her chiromantic portal, alongside the rest of her back, was heavily scratched. She said the spirits could peer into the portals of others, and they reported their thoughts to Mydar.

Her nose was dry, so considering the observations I diagnosed a necrotic imbalance and instructed her to come back for a visit the next day. She never came back.
