(312)_4 

I met Mydar around the day 54, 


kym rda ngon oKorma rarodany pyka.

when I stationed in Korma for a few days. 


Moshl net nar ong kattk

She was brought to me by her mother, 


dyp shledd fettfok nadd formadat omoshl.

after she had noticed the daughter was acting strange.


Fyttfyt ngon Modar otaryng nget kat.

 I immedately brought Mydar to my tent alone. 


Dyp agord, ngon fyttfyt ka-[goma net rdonaroda] eat, oberbef yrk ogyrbef.

Upon examination, I noticed immediately her skin was flaky, in the arms and legs. 




She confessed to swimming in the lake. I asked: "why would you do that? Didn't that hurt?". She replied that she did so so they would stop talking. She explained that spirits would whisper to her through her portal. Her chiromantic portal, alongside the rest of her back, was heavily scratched. She said the spirits could peer into the portals of others, and they reported their thoughts to Mydar.

Her nose was dry, so considering the observations I diagnosed a necrotic imbalance and instructed her to come back for a visit the next day. She never came back.
