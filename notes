# Flavus

Flavus is a smallish Earth-like planet orbiting a K0-class star. The common name refers to the planet's distinctly yellow tint, due to surface sulfur deposits.

# Climate

The axial tilt of Flavus is extremely modest, which leads to an imperceptible seasonal cycle and small polar circles. The temperature variation due to eccentricity of the orbit is even larger, though still minute. Therefore any given location on Flavus does not experience much difference in temperatures throughout the year.

The average surface temperature is significantly higher than on Earth. Only the polar regions, which host tropical-like climates, are inhabitable by humans. Intermediate latitudes are occupied by a vast, dry, acidic desert.

# The sulfur cycle

Flavus slowly alternates between short periods of intense volcanism and long pauses of geological inactivity. During the former, copious amount of sulfur are produced, which are turned into fine dust and diluted into the sands of the planet.

When elemental sulfur concentration in sand exceeds a certain threshold, the possibility arises for a fire. Sulfur fires are awesome and terrifying, spreading quickly and then burning for days with a deep blue glow. Fires produce large columns of toxic sulfur dioxide.

The inverse direction is provided by the lifeforms native to the planet, the Plunts, which during photosynthesis consume sulfur dioxide in addition to carbon dioxide. Plunts store the absorbed sulfur in elemental form as small stones called *calculi*, which they release after their death.

At equilibrium, this feedback pair mantains a constant concentration of elemental sulfur in the sand and sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. The latter (at ~ 10 ppm, to be compared with Earth's 1 ppm) is low enough for humans to survive, but still results in some permanently acidic rains and bodies of water.

# Flora

The dominant native lifeforms of Flavus are a large class of plant-like creatures known colloquially as Plunts. Plunts perform a variant of photosynthesis in which sulfur dioxide can be also processed alongside carbon dioxide; the relevant combination of pygments (including clorophyll) gives almost all plunts a purple-blue colour.

Plunts however also possess animal-like traits; they are in fact often capable of limited locomotion and have primitive nervous-like systems. But it's the nature of their reproductive habits that is priceless for the human inhabitants of Flavus. The male organ of a Plunt consists of an elastic sac which is filled by sperm capsules over the course of a few months. When the pressure is sufficiently high, the sac bursts releasing the capsules, which are designed to be then transported by wind. The female organ instead produces an egg-like structure, a translucent white ovoid with a thick rubbery skin filled with a sugary protein syrup. The egg is topped by a receptacle, the true female organ. When a sperm capsule reaches a receptacle, a Plunt embryo is conceived and transferred to the egg.

The new individual is gestated for months inside the egg, which then hatches to reveal a cyan toadpole-like larva. The larva has some locomotive ability which it uses to get as far away as possible from the mother over the course of a few days. It then burrows the tail into the sand and becomes sessile, entering its adult stage.

Humans eat almost exclusively unfertilized plunt eggs, since they are relatively nutrient and not toxic like most of the organs of most plunt species. Growing eggs is relatively easy, consisting essentially in sealing the receptacle so that it cannot be fertilized. Plunt eggs are more agreeable when cooked, and are slightly alcaline with an ammonia-like smell.

Plunts do not have any signficantly rigid components. They are always elastic to some extent and their trunks are analogous to the tentacles of mollusks, being kept in position (or moved) through a hydraulic system. Their gummy purple skin is covered in a watery mucus, acting as an insulant to protect them from the extreme heat.

# Humans

The most intelligent inhabitants on the planet are humans, or Flavans. What exactly they are doing there is unknown, and Flavans have no understanding of recollection of Earth, nor of the fact that they are not native to Flavus. Nevertheless, the planet is a harsh, inhospitable environment, with its dry, hot climate and acidic chemistry, and apparently Flavans have still not completely adapted accordingly, testifying that they haven't been around for more than a handful of millennia. Still, the small effect of these hardships on the bodies of humans are perceptible already. Flavans:

- grow 5 to 10 cm taller than Earthlings as a consequence of the lower gravity, which also increases chances of bone and heart-related diseases. 
- have very light skin, since UV radiation on the surface is low, owing to Flavus' star low temperature. A darker skin tone would facilitate vitamin D deficiency and has been quickly selected against.
- have respiratory and digestive systems slightly more suited for acidic environments. 

Flavans live in nuclear communities (*pak*), analogous to villages and averaging 200 individuals, based in oases in the arctic regions. Frequently, travelling groups will hop between oases by crossing the desert, carrying goods, knowledge, and money.

Two main ethnic branches inhabit the Arctic. The Demorog ("square-writing") occupy the pole, the upper, left, and lower regions, while the Bymarog ("flame-writing") live in a strip in the upper-right. It makes little sense to distuinguish smaller subdivisions as Flavan cultures, by virtue of their nature, constantly mix and rearrange.

# Travel, shrooms and bannering

Oases are small specks in a vast, unforgiving and extraordinarily bland desert, with very few recognizable points. A traveling group walking straight into the desert in a random direction could very well walk to their death without ever sighting a village. Orientation doesn't help much, as even a small error can build up and the destination could be missed entirely. How do travelers on Flavus manage to move around consistently? The solution is provided by the single largest living beings on the planet: shrooms.

Shrooms are gigantic mushroom shaped plunts, between 100 and 200 m tall, and inhabit primarily the polar desert, avoiding the excessive humidity of the oases. They have impressive root systems, sometimes even a kilometre across, to extract the necessary nutrients for survival. The "stalk" is relatively thin (two to three metres in diametre) but equipped with a powerful hydraulic pump is able to sustain the weight of the very large "cap", actually a disc-shaped layer of branches and leaf-organs. The cap itself is very light and little dense. Shroom (and their caps in particular) are home to rich ecosystems including parasites, symbionts, and predators.

Travelers use shrooms primarily as reliable reference points. Shrooms live easily for centuries, and skilled Masters can recognize individual shrooms from the shape of the cap, even from kilometres away. Shrooms are marked on maps and named, and traveling routes "hopping" from shroom to shroom are established. Not only: even if it wasn't for orientation, shrooms still make for attractive stops for travelers: the stalk can be cut to drip out sap, which is easily filtered for drinking, and its large (although distant, considering the Sun's low altitude) shadow, where the group can rest. Sadly, they cannot literally stop in the cap's shadow and drop the tents: the shroom is so tall that the shadow moves too fast throughout the day, forcing travelers to continuously move every half-hour.

Upon passing by an undiscovered shroom, the Master will mark it with a banner of their village (or occasionally one of the recently visited villages), a flag-like piece of cloth bearing the pak name. These banner are manufactured in advance by children in the pak and travelers always carry a few. The banner has a pouch in which travelers insert "update documents": writings reporting on their travel, maps, news on the recently visited villages, general updates, and a bit of gratuitous personal diary. The next visitors to the shrooms can then enjoy this information and add their own to the shroom's archive. Travelers communicate much more information through bannering than through actually meeting in travel, which happens rarely.

# Villages

# Sex, Gender and Parenthood

Flavans don't like children. Even in what is relatively speaking an oasis, the harsh lifestyle makes survival of the community the first preoccupation; procreation, and thus a noticeable population increase in a small village is seen as damaging. Bearing child is therefore heavily regulated and the mother is required to pay the *pak* authority a fee whose value is regularly updated depending on the village's situation. Failure to produce the money can result in expulsion.

This "demographic phobia" has its origin in Flavan folklore of villages destroyed by overpopulation, and results in very unusual ideas on sex drive, reproduction, gender, and the role of children in society. Children are perceived as "impure", "indecent" or more precisely "unstructured"; physician Baryk-t Ardeman describes the process of growing a child into an adult as akin to the drying of gum-birch skin, removing its toxic "blue" essence to reveal a structured individual:

*the child is born as an amalgalm of the elements, imbibued with blue as the skin of the gum-birch. Living amongst the yellow, it is dried, and the blue drips, and it takes face.*

The genitals and nose of children are always to be covered in public, and the distinction between child and adult is stronger than even that between male and female, a feature reflected in the Flavan language. A child is grown and educated by his mother only; there is no concept of fatherhood on Flavus. The biological father has no responsibilities nor rights concerning the child. The closest idea to fatherhood is a form of tutorage in which an adult (almost always male) trains a child in various skills, most importantly reading and writing and the basic of travelling; it's not uncommon for an emotional bond to develop, nor is it frowned upon. A child can have any number of tutors.

Children become adults as they reach ... Visits (... Earth years) of age, at which point they are "uncovered" in a ceremony. To emphasize that the adult Flavan is not far from being considered a distinct person from themselves as a child, adults count their age starting from their uncovering.

Because reproduction is almost always seen in such a negative light, Flavans rationalize the sex drive as "intrinsic suffering" to being alive, and in alignment with their philosophy believe that like all forms of pain it should be embraced and redirected towards good or constructive purposes. Therefore, they understand the need for recreational sex. There is variety in the sexual habits of Flavans, but an obvious constraint is that vaginal penetration is forbidden (unless the woman is prepared to have - and pay for - a child). Demorog do not really perceive any difference between male and female and tend to engage in often short, vaguely monogamous relationships, either heterosexual or homosexual. Bymarog forbid all recreational heterosexual contact, but gladly accept homosexual (male and female) pairings, but do not have any concept of relationship or commitment at all.

The body of a Flavan is considered their most prized possession, because of the suffering associated with owning it. (In fact, the female body is regarded as even more valuable, because of the menstrual cycle and the associated physical pain and discomfort). Therefore, Flavans classify rape as a form of theft, which is an unforgivable sin. All forms of rape are punished with expulsion, in addition to the child fee in case the rape results in a pregnancy.

The reason for reduced gender differences in Flavan society is mostly that there is neither much hunting, nor child-bearing to do on Flavus. (Side note: Flavans would not be able to understand an arrow symbol). Gathering, building and travelling require skills common to both sexes and almost all roles in Flavan society include men and women in comparable fractions. Flavan grammar does not distinguish male and female, and while most proper names are indeed gendered, a good portion of them are Unisex. In fact, the very physician quoted above, Ardeman of the Baryk village, bears such a name and it's not possible from their writing to infer whether they were a man or a woman.

# Culture

When they laugh, Flavans take out their tongue and keep it between their teeth.

# Science

# Astronomy and Religion 

In addition to the fixed stars, the only two astronomical objects that the Flavans are aware of are the Star and the Wanderer (Vulcan being too close to the Star to be visible). Flavans believe these two objects to be identified with two gods, 

The Wanderer is a bright, spectacular sight when in opposition, that is when it is closest to Flavus, and reaches maximum altitude at midnight. In fact, Flavans measure years as spanning between consecutive oppositions (which they call "visits") of the Wanderer, instead of through the motion of their sun on the fixed stars as it is done on Earth. Thus, Flavans prefer the synodic period of the Wanderer with respect to Flavus, rather than Flavus' own sidereal period, to act as a measure of time. This choice is coherent both with the absence of detectable seasons and with the secondary role the "fixed" stars have in Flavan cosmology.

# Flavan Language and Writing

Flavan writing arises from the practical need of mapmaking. Since mutual intelligibility is key, Flavans essentially all use one unified script, but with distinct styles of rendering shapes. The Flavan script was originally an alphabet (with consonant and vowels being represented by distinct glyphs) but has transitioned into an abugida as consonant and vowel glyphs have fused into new forms. It is written vertically, more precisely top-to-bottom, right-to-left; words within a single column are separated by a dot.

The most bizzarre aspect is the writing tool Flavans use, the pen-leech. Pen-leeches are parasitic worm-like animals distributed throughout the Polar regions, and which feed on large plunts, in particular shrooms. The pen-leech attaches to the trunk of the plunt through its two cartilage fangs; when secured to the skin it squeezes out a corrosive mucus, essentially digesting the host externally, then sucks back the mucus into its body for absorption. This cycle is repeated. Pen-leeches are barely taxing on the gigantic shrooms and the latter can often host hundreds or thousand of parasites with no real damage to itself. Flavans exploit the leeches' sucking and splurting ability to use them as pens. Travellers collect a few as they hop by a shroom. Once brought home to the village, they are prepared as such:

- The brain node, in the posterior of the creature, is cut off alongside the vestigial root. This kills the leech :(
- The carthilage fangs are removed carefully to retain a smooth, circular mouth.
- The leech is cleaned and hanged to dry out the sap

The pen-leech, now more rigid and elastic, is then ready to be used similarly to a fountain pen, sucking in an ink produced from ashes, and releasing it on paper when squeezed. This gives rise to the characteristic roundish strokes in Flavan writing. Pen leeches do not last more than a month before starting to rot, and thus must be replaced frequently - therefore, there is no such thing as a "luxury" pen-leech, even though a skilled pen-leech preparer is highly regarded.

Writing styles can be split roughly into three general categories:

- The Demorog "geometric" style, mostly employed in embroidered or chiseled designs or in very large writings (such as on walls). Occasionally also used in tattoos and maps.
- The Demorog "cursive" style, for maps, letters, books, and everything in pen-leech.
- The Bymarog "flame" style

Here are the words *Demorog* (right) and *Bymarog* (left) themselves, written respectively in geometric, cursive, and flame style.

The words denoting the two ethnic groups themselves (Demorog = square-writing, Bymarog = flame-writing) refer to the appearance of these writing styles.

# Music

Flavan music is strongly percussive and almost always based on a specific 5/4 rhythm:



And melodies are played in a hexatonic scale:


Music is played by traveling "bands" composed of a Drummer, a Lead vocalist, and one or two Backing vocalists. Songs take a vaguely choral form as the backing vocalist open by singing the title/refrain in a constant note; this works as an "introduction" to the piece of music, and also establishes the fundamental note and the tempo. The Drummer joins in and the Backing continues to hum the refrain on the fundamental. After, the Lead introduces the main melody and lyrics, harmonizing on the backing's drone. Flavan music is thus essentially biphonic, though the bass is simply a drone, very rarely changing. Lyrics almost always tell a story, either humorous (and vulgar) or tragic, and the refrain itself is very often an ironic twist on the subject that is only understood after the main lyrics are presented, even though it gets continuously repeated throughout the song. Sometimes, the refrain even rhymes with the last verse of the lyrics.

A translated Demorog example:



Refrain: it's empty like death

Abar of the Shefe village has
brimstone hair and silver sweatdrops
Rkon of the Bybang village wants
the sweet green breasts
that Abar of the Shefe village has.

But everytime that Rkon comes
to Shefe village and Abar's tent
Abar's mother is always there.

Abar writes a letter then,
come to visit in seven days,
and no one will be in the tent.

Rkon of the Bybang village reads,
Rkon walks from here to there
sulfur feet he has to have
He enters Abar's tent and

(it's empty like death)



In this interesting example, the refrain is doubly deceiving as it also sets up a dramatic mood which is then inverted by the humorous subject. The expression "empty like death" refers to the fact that the internal organs of dead plunts decay much faster than their skin, which leaves them with a "deflated balloon" appearance. The curious combination "green breasts" makes sense in the context of Flavan perception of colour, and probably refers to a grayish-pinkish hue of very pale skin.
